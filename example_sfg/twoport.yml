# Define source nodes, sink nodes and other nodes
sources:
    - Vin
sinks:
    - V2    # We can use V2 directly as the sink node
nodes:
    - V1
    - I1
    - I2

# Define edges
# Each edge has a format of `u ~> v: f`, where the edge points from node `u`
# to node `v`, with a transfer function of `f`. `f` is convertible to a
# SymPy expression.
edges:
    Vin ~> V1: 1    # Constants are acceptable

    # Admittance matrix
    V1 ~> I1: y11   # Symbols are acceptable
    V2 ~> I1: y12
    V1 ~> I2: y21
    V2 ~> I2: y22

    # Impedances
    I1 ~> V1: -Rin  # Expressions are acceptable
    I2 ~> V2: -RL
